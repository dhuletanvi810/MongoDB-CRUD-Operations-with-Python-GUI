# MongoDB-CRUD-Operations-with-Python-GUI

*DESCRIPTION*

This project presents a CRUD operation on a Tech Products Database using Python Tkinter and MongoDB. 
It enables users to add, view, update, and delete product-related records such as Product Name, Customer Name, Email, Phone, Age, and Gender. The system provides a simple GUI for efficient data management, demonstrating the integration of MongoDB with Python for desktop applications.
This project focuses on developing a Tech Products App with integrated CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Python Tkinter for the graphical interface and MongoDB as the database. The application is designed to manage a Tech Product Database that stores essential details such as Product Name, Customer Name, Email, Phone, Age, and Gender. Users can easily insert new records, view all data in a tabular format, update existing entries, and delete unwanted records. The GUI is user-friendly, allowing smooth interaction with the database without requiring direct MongoDB queries.
The implementation of this CRUD module demonstrates how Python and MongoDB can be combined to build a simple yet efficient database-driven desktop application. It highlights the importance of database management in real-world software systems and serves as the foundation for scaling the Tech Products App with advanced features such as authentication, search filters, and product categorization in the future.
